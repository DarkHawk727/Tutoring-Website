# Matt Starai Tutoring Website

This is a repository for the Matt Starai Tutoring Website. The first iteration was done in boostrap studio. For this iteration, I will be using `react.js`.
I used `bulma.css` for the styling. This site includes the following pages:

- Homepage
- About
- Contact
- Job Application Pages
- Book a Tutoring Session Pages
- FAQ

## TODO by Page

### Site-wide

- General refinments
- Figure out how to make the buttons with AOS faster

### Homepage

- Resize univeristy images
- Maybe use [tiles](https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/tiles/) for the testimonials to allow for varied lengths.

### Jobs & Schedule a Session

- Send the application as an email using firebase
- Redo the progress bar using `o-steps` where each question answered increases the progress bar
- Add functionality for required fields checking

### FAQ

- Make the collapsible functionality work
- Make the expand logo go on the right side
