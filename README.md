# Matt Starai Tutoring Website

This is a repository for the Matt Starai Tutoring Website. The first iteration was done in boostrap studio. For this iteration, I will be using `react.js`.
I used `bulma.css` for the styling. This site includes the following pages:

- Homepage
- About
- Contact
- Job Application Page
- FAQ

## TODO by Page
