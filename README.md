# Matt Starai Tutoring Website

This is a repository for the Matt Starai Tutoring Website. The first iteration was done in boostrap studio. For this iteration, I will be using `react.js`.
I used `bulma.css` for the styling.

## TODO

* Navbar (change the logo)
* Go over all the text

At some point i should not hardcode a lot of the menu items, but for now I will.
